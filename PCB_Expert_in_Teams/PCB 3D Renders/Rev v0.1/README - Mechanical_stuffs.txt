This is the first version of the PCB I expect to re-design it. My idea is that you will get an idea of the electronics footprint. I was thinking that you can use the design as an idea and from there further design the mechanical part of the device. I can make the PCB curved or split it up if need be, but the circuit was actually smaller than I expected so maybe there is hope it can stay as 1 PCB. 

Once you get an idea of how the PCB can fit. You can design the housing and then export a 2D .DXF file of the exact dimensions of the size the PCB should be. From that DXF file I can import it into the PCB design program (KICAD) and then make that DXF file the PCB outline and then move components and re-route them to fit the desired PCB dimensions (your DXF file). If you have any questions, just ask.

Also, if it is if you have desired placement of holes contact me and we can figure out where they should be.
Below are the electronics components that are not apart of the PCB so speakers, haptic motors and hopefully soon the scent emitter.
 
Speakers 2x (one on each side)

Haptic motors (3) left, right and back of neck.

NOTE: I added the USBC port so you can use the datasheet for creating the dimensions of the port so it can stick out of the device.
